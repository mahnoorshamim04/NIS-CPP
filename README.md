# NIS-CPP
This project presents the design, implementation, and security analysis of a custom Composite Vigenère Cipher. We rigorously evaluated its resistance against both statistical (Frequency Analysis) and algebraic (Known-Plaintext Attack) methods, identifying critical structural weaknesses and proposing necessary security enhancements.
